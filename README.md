# Simple Neo4j browser based on yFiles for Html 

A more extended description of what this application does and how it all fits together is found in [this article](http://www.orbifold.net/default/neo4j-client/).

- The Neo4j backend is populated with data from [ConceptNet](http://maxdemarzi.com/2013/05/13/knowledge-bases-in-neo4j/)
- The middleware is running NodeJS with the [Neo4j-js module](https://github.com/bretcope/neo4j-js).
- [yFiles for Html](http://www.yWorks.com) is mimicing the Cypher browser behavior.
- [Jade](http://jade-lang.com) is used as a template engine within the [NodeJS Express](http://expressjs.com) framework
- [Kendo UI](http://www.kendoui.com) was used for some UI sugar.
